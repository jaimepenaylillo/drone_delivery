# Drone Delivery Service

Test for Velozient, the requiriment is detailed next:

A squad of drones have been tasked with delivering packages for a major online reseller in a
world where time and distance do not matter. Each drone can carry a specific weight, and
can make multiple deliveries before returning to home base to pick up additional loads;
however the goal is to make the fewest number of trips as each time the drone returns to
home base it is extremely costly to refuel and reload the drone.
The purpose of the written software will be to accept input which will include the name of
each drone and the maximum weight it can carry, along with a series of locations and the
total weight needed to be delivered to that specific location. The software should highlight
the most efficient deliveries for each drone to make on each trip.

Assume that time and distance to each drop off location do not matter, and that size of each
package is also irrelevant. It is also assumed that the cost to refuel and restock each drone is
a constant and does not vary between drones. The maximum number of drones in a squad
is 100, and there is no maximum number of deliveries which are required.

Lastly, please supply an input data file. The client should be able to run the project and have
the results displayed.

Given Input
Line 1: [Drone #1 Name], [#1 Maximum Weight], [Drone #2 Name], [#2 Maximum Weight],
etc.
Line 2: [Location #1 Name], [Location #1 Package Weight]
Line 3: [Location #2 Name], [Location #2 Package Weight]
Line 4: [Location #3 Name], [Location #3 Package Weight]
Etc.
Expected Output
[Drone #1 Name]
Trip #1
[Location #2 Name], [Location #3 Name]
Trip #2

[Location #1 Name]

[Drone #2 Name]
Trip #1
[Location #4 Name], [Location #7 Name]
Trip #2
[Location #5 Name], [Location #6 Name]

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
    <GenerateProgramFile>false</GenerateProgramFile>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Bogus" Version="33.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="Figgle" Version="0.4.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="json.net" Version="1.0.33" />

    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>

## Execution of program. ‚öôÔ∏è

For this example I hade create some Data Facke, using a NugetPackage called Bogus, this allow us to have randomic data, to test our application.

There are two ways to perform this task,

1.  To Run the project just

    dotnet run

2.  inside the directory,

        \bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1

    you have the file,

        drone_delivery.exe

clicking it you can execute the console application.

After that a console Aplication is been rised, asking for number of Drone in the fleet, you can input Eg. 100, after that the number of locations.
As is required the data is displayed: as follows:

EG. Using 2 as Drones in Fleet and 5 Locations.

$ dotnet run
